    In this project I will show that I have some basic proficiency in HTML by creating a recipe page that will link to three recipes&comma; and showcase unordered and ordered lists on their ingredients and the steps necessary to cook the dishes. I will then publish this in Github and hopefully everything will look basic and snazzy.
